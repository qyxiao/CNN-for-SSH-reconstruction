This repository contains all jupyter notebooks that are needed to redo the analysis presented in this paper. Versions of important python packages used in this project are: Xarray - 0.17.0, Pytorch - 1.10.1, Numpy - 1.19.2, xhistogram - 0.3.2, matplotlib - 3.6.0, xgcm - 0.8.0, scipy - 1.9.1.

The CNN model setup and training is shown in model_example.ipynb. In figure 5.ipynb we use figure 5 as an example to show how we make plots in X-Y plane and how we calculate and plot vorticity-strain joint distributions. In figure 8.ipynb we use figure 8 as an example to show how to apply a trained model to reconstruct vorticity in the test region. In figure 19 we show how to calculate CKA used in figure 19.

Regarding data used in this paper, both the [channel simulation](https://catalog.pangeo.io/browse/master/ocean/channel/channel_ridge_resolutions_01km/) and [LLC4320](https://catalog.pangeo.io/browse/master/ocean/LLC4320/) are accessible through [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/). The synthetic internal waves data is generated using matlab package [GLOceanKit](https://github.com/Energy-Pathways-Group/GLOceanKit).
